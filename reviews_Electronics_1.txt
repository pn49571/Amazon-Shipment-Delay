Rate it.\" Just as if they'd actually been delivered.So it had to be shipped back to the factory (where it stayed for 5 weeks), so they could \"look at it.\" Over a month later, I got a call from them saying that \"Philips CD recorders are only designed to work with Philips exclusive CDR blank media.\" My first problem with this is that apparently nobody who sells Philips recorders knows this--or they just don't tell you-- and Philips consumer electronics, themselves, don't tell you in the instructions, on the box, or even at their helpline 1-800 number.I bought it on a whim through EBAY for $125 shipped and received it a mere 2 days afterwards.I have now been waiting 2 months for this part to be shipped by Phillips and the part has still not arrived (supposedly the part is back-ordered - I suspect because this is a common problem...)As putting 2 CD's in the same tray is a error that occurs to everyone once in a while, I would strongly caution potential purchasers of the MC70 to think carefully about buying this system because of this  serious design flaw.It was shipped very quickly to me.I said okay, and it was shipped to me.They shipped one for free, and the camera still failed to work.I had one of the frames shipped to my house to personally set up and  observe functionality - the other one was shipped directly to the more  technically-adept family member.The other was  shipped to me and the first one had a bad phone jack which prevented it  from dialing in for updates.I thought, no problem, call  customer support and get a unit shipped overnight (Saturday arrival).I called  customer support (877 MY FRAME) and was told &quot;no way could a unit be  shipped out, it was Friday of a Holiday weekend, everyone went home.I had the Ceiva shipped to them and did not tell them it was coming.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Review of Smartmediacard", "unixReviewTime": 1155427200, "reviewTime": "08 13, 2006"}
